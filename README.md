###  Simon

The bot, Simon, plays the role of a life coach in which members of a server can talk to the bot about their personal challenges. By virtue of this, Simon will then try
to have a greater understanding of the issue by asking further questions and then give recommendations on how to overcome those issues. Additonally, he may also
recommend self-development resources such as books and podcasts. It is to be noted that this bot was created by integrating OpenAI's API so as to provide that
convenient life coach-client experience.
